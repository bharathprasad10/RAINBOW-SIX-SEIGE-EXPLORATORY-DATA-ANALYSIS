# RAINBOW-SIX-SEIGE-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
Using the R6 velvet shell data set, we're attempting to uncover hidden trends and patterns in operators, maps, game types, and other variables in order to identify the greatest and worst operators, as well as the finest weapons and attachments.

## Abstract
R6 is a widely played multiplayer shooting video game in which players take on the roles of attackers or defenders. Using the R6 velvet shell data set, we're attempting to uncover hidden trends and patterns in operators, maps, game types, and other variables in order to identify the greatest and worst operators, as well as the finest weapons and attachments. This in-depth understanding would also aid gamers and game developers in comprehending the operators' and maps' strengths and limitations.

## Aim of the project
* Who are the best operators for both Attacker and Defender roles in each map?
* Which are the best attachments for primary weapons?
* What are the main reasons for victory?
* Are there any operators who are incomparably better than the others?

## Data
The dataset is collected directly from ubisoft website.
